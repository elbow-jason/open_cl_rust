/// The opencl-low-level crate is the lowest level crate of opencl that provides
/// functions that take common rust data structures (slice, vec, non-cl
/// primitives) as arguments for OpenCL's FFI.
///
/// The *true* lowest level crate for opencl is opencl-sys, but that package is
/// almost entirely a product of rust-bindgen.
///
/// Given the direct use of FFI in opencl-low-level and the fact that
/// mismanagement of the lifetimes of the pointer objects returned by many
/// OpenCL functions can easily lead to undefined behavior, there is a VERY
/// LARGE CAVEAT for using opencl-low-level functions and data structure
/// directly: KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
///
/// The pointers for OpenCL are all safe to send between threads, but neither
/// OpenCL nor the opencl-low-level library (this lib) provide synchronization
/// mechanism to protect Session from concurrent mutable access.

/// Additionally, nearly all structs, functions, method, and traits in
/// opencl-low-level are unsafe. The reasoning behind the, quite frankly,
/// extreme amount of unsafe code in the low-level crate is the danger of
/// working with raw pointers, manually managed atomic reference counting,
/// pointer object lifetime interdependency, dangling pointers, buffer overflows,
/// segmentation faults, shaky knees, sweaty palms, and self doubt...
